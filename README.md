# SQ8L

This project is a reverse engineered version of the audio engine from the infamous SQ8L VST3 plugin. I became interested
in SQ8L after watching a [video][1] from Ski Oakenfull. After I learned that SQ8L was pretty much abandonware, I decided
to take on reversing it as a project to learn more about [Ghidra][2] and [Frida][3].

## Status

Over the past two years I worked on and off on the project. All parts of the audio engine have been identified and
reverse engineered. However, there are still loads of bugs which means that the engine is not yet in a working state. So
don't expect too much.
